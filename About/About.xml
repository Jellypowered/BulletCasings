    <description>Adds bullet casings, which fly out of weapons when fired (visuals!). Also adds AK-47 assault rifle.
	
While this mod does not add ammo, it does add the appearance of ammo being used by throwing empty casings out of weapons when they are fired. Default casings are assault rifle casings, there is shotgun and charge weapon variants, the latter of which are meant to be slightly humorous.

The AK-47 has been added because I had the texture lying around and I really wanted the communist counterpiece to the M16-style assault rifle we have in game. It has worse accuracy and range than the assault rifle and the bullets do less damage, but it shoots five round bursts and is very forgiving for bad shooters at short ranges. Long range it's ineffective for most shooters, but very skilled ones can make it compete with the assault rifle.</description>
