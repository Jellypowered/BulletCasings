    <description>Adds bullet casings, which fly out of weapons when fired (visuals!).
	
While this mod does not add ammo, it does add the appearance of ammo being used by throwing empty casings out of weapons when they are fired. Default casings are assault rifle casings, there is shotgun and charge weapon variants, the latter of which are meant to be slightly humorous.</description>
